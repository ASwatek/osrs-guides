# 2t Prifddinas Teaks Guide

This guide will fully explain how to perform the 2t teaks method in prifddinas. The method is almost the same as 2t teaks on ape atoll, but here we accrue crystal shards and the movement between trees is more complicated. Note that the quest Song of the Elves is needed to access Prifddinas .

This method to move between trees is different than heboxjonge's method. Unlike his, this method works for 3t weapons with ammo, works for 2t weapons, and doesn't change the rhythm. This method also saves 2 ticks with a godly reaction time, while his doesn't.

## Step 0: Get geared

We will bring along our lumberjack outfit for increased experience and a 2-tick or 3-tick weapon to autoretaliate with. A common choice is magic shortbow or hunter's crossbow, both without ammo, but cool people use darts. Bring an axe to woodcut, preferably a dragon, infernal, or crystal axe.

Be sure not to bring a woodcutting cape, as it increases the chance of nests dropping, which provide no experience. It can also be helpful to bring along an item to teleport away when done with woodcutting. The butterfly net and impling jar are to catch passing crystal imps, and the teleport crystal is to get to Prifddinas.

## Step 1: Aggro the rabbits

To aggro the rabbits, we cast wind strike against them. Since the max hit is two and the rabbits have five hitpoints, this will never kill them. Another common choice is to cast confuse or a similar spell, which deals no damage.

## Step 2: Every other tick the rabbits

At this point, we're almost ready to start woodcutting, but we first need to set up the rabbits. Here there's three cases, depending on the position of the rabbits.

### i. Adjacent rabbits

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JjuC5Iu.gif" alt='Gear needed' width=500>

We click on an empty tile (among the highlighted tiles) on a hitsplat tick; on the next tick, we click to move back to between the eastern trees.

### ii. Stacked rabbits

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lrzo8cM.gif" alt='Gear needed' width=500>

We click the tile in front of the western tree; then, we click the tile between the eastern trees on a hitsplat tick.

### iii. Safespotted rabbits

It's extremely rare but possible that both rabbits become safespotted, stuck behind one of the eastern trees. There's three configurations here: Both are north, both are south, and one is north while one is south. Below we show how to handle these.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wGEYRl9.gif" alt='Method for safespotted rabbits' width=500>

The only convenient method to handle all three configurations is to run out then run back, which converts the rabbits to being adjacent, which was handled in case i.

## Step 3: Primary technique

Below we see the primary technique for performing 2t teaks. When we do the method, this part will take up the lion's share of our time.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vEALCT2.gif" alt='Gear needed' width=500>

We click a tree on a hitsplat tick. On the next tick, we click to cancel interacting with the tree. Commonly this is done by clicking to fletch, clicking the ground underneath us or a tree, or clicking to drop logs. Repeat this, in a two tick rhythm.

This method involves our character being flinched every other tick for a 1t skilling delay, then woodcutting instead of attacking when the timer goes off on the next tick. Since auto retaliating is only possible when your character is not interacting with anything, you must click to cancel your interaction on the tick before the hitsplat.

## Step 4: Moving between spots

In this step, we solve the problem of having all of the trees around us fallen by moving to another tree. The movement has to be done in two parts, since the first part needs to drag one rabbit and then the second part is needed to unobstruct the tile for the other rabbit.

### i.  Moving from east to west

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WjqsMlX.gif" alt='Gear needed' width=500>

On a tick after a hitsplat, we click the highlighted tile. On the next tick, we click the western tree. On the following tick, we continue cancelling and restarting interacting with the tree. Note that the tick after a hitsplat can be on the tick a tree falls (if you have godly reaction times) or two ticks after. If we react two ticks after the tree falls, we must click the ground on the hitsplat ticks to prevent attacking the rabbits.

### ii. Moving from west to east

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jqsXdOv.gif" alt='Gear needed' width=500>

On a tick after a hitsplat, we click the highlighted tile. On the next tick, we click the south-eastern tree. On the following tick, we continue cancelling and restarting interacting with the tree. Note that the tick after a hitsplat can be on the tick a tree falls (if you have godly reaction times) or two ticks after. If we react two ticks after the tree falls, we must click the ground on the hitsplat ticks to prevent attacking the rabbits.
