# 2t Prifddinas Teaks Guide

This guide will fully explain how to perform the 2t teaks method in Prifddinas. The method is almost the same as 2t teaks on Ape Atoll, but here we accrue crystal shards and the movement between trees is more complicated. Note that the quest Song of the Elves is needed to access Prifddinas.

## Step 0: Get geared

We will bring along our lumberjack outfit for increased experience and a 2-tick or 3-tick weapon to autoretaliate with. A common choice is a magic shortbow or a hunter's crossbow, both without ammo, but cool people use darts. Bring an axe to woodcut, preferably a dragon, infernal, or crystal axe.

Be sure not to bring a woodcutting cape, as it increases the chance of no-experience nests dropping instead of logs. It can also be helpful to bring along an item to teleport away when done with woodcutting. A butterfly net and impling jar can be brought to catch passing crystal imps. In our inventory we also have a Teleport Crystal to get to Prifddinas.

## Step 1: Aggro the rabbits

To aggro the rabbits, we cast wind strike against them. Since the max hit is two and the rabbits have five hitpoints, we will never kill them. Another common choice is to cast confuse or a similar spell, which deals no damage.

It's helpful to set our npc attack options to "hidden" to keep us from accidentally killing the rabbits.

## Step 2: Every other tick the rabbits

At this point, we're almost ready to start woodcutting, but we first need to set up the rabbits. Here there's three cases, depending on the position of the rabbits.

### i. Adjacent rabbits

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JjuC5Iu.gif" alt='Every other ticking adjacent rabbits' width=500>

We click on an empty tile (among the highlighted tiles) on a hitsplat tick. Then, we click to move back to between the eastern trees.

### ii. Stacked rabbits

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lrzo8cM.gif" alt='Every other ticking stacked rabbits' width=500>

We click the tile in front of the western tree; then, on a hitsplat tick, we click the tile between the eastern trees.

### iii. Safespotted rabbits

It's extremely rare but possible that both rabbits become safespotted, stuck behind one of the eastern trees. There's three configurations here: Both are north, both are south, and one is north while one is south. Below we show how to handle these.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wGEYRl9.gif" alt='Method for safespotted rabbits' width=500>

The only convenient method to handle all three configurations is to run out then run back, which converts the rabbits to being adjacent, which was handled in the first case.

## Step 3: Main technique

Below we see the primary technique for performing 2t teaks. When we are doing this method, this part takes up the lion's share of our time. [Here is a longer clip](https://streamable.com/rto1c) of doing the method, including movement between trees.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vEALCT2.gif" alt='Main technique' width=500>


We click a tree on a hitsplat tick. On the next tick, we click to cancel interacting with the tree. Commonly this is done by clicking to fletch, clicking the ground underneath us or a tree, or clicking to drop logs. We repeat this, in a two tick rhythm.

This method involves our character being flinched every other tick for a 1t skilling delay, then woodcutting instead of attacking when the timer goes off on the next tick. Since auto retaliating is only possible when your character is not interacting with anything, we must click to cancel your interaction on the tick before the hitsplat.

## Step 4: Moving between spots

In this step, we solve the problem of having all of the trees around us fallen by moving to another tree. The movement has to be done in two parts, since the first part needs to drag one rabbit and then the second part is needed to unobstruct the tile for the other rabbit.

This method to move between trees is different than heboxjonge's method. Unlike his, this method works for 3t weapons with ammo, works for 2t weapons, and doesn't change the rhythm. This method also saves 2 ticks with a godly reaction time, while his doesn't.

### i.  Moving from east to west

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WjqsMlX.gif" alt='Moving west' width=500>


On a tick after a hitsplat, we click the highlighted tile. On the next tick, we click the western tree. On the following tick, we continue cancelling and restarting interacting with the tree as in the main technique. Note that the tick after a hitsplat can be on the tick a tree falls (if we have godly reaction times) or two ticks after. If we react two ticks after the tree falls, we must click the ground on the hitsplat tick before moving to prevent attacking the rabbits.

### ii. Moving from west to east

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jqsXdOv.gif" alt='Moving east' width=500>


On a tick after a hitsplat, we click the highlighted tile. On the next tick, we click the south-eastern tree. On the following tick, we continue cancelling and restarting interacting with the tree. Note that the tick after a hitsplat can be on the tick a tree falls (if we have godly reaction times) or two ticks after. If we react two ticks after the tree falls, we must click the ground on the hitsplat ticks to prevent attacking the rabbits.
